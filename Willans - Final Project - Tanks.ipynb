    "### Purpose/Abstract\n",
    "The goal for this project was to create a tanks game using vpython. It features 8 levels, where you must use the tank to hit the target.The game takes place on Mars, so the gravity and air resistance behave the same as they would. \n",
    "Along with the air drag on the ammo, there's a wind component which will mess with the shots velocity while it travels through the air. \n",
    "Before each shot, the user can adjust the power, angle, and spin.  "

    "#### Magnus Effect\n",
    "The magnus effect is the force acting on a rotating ball, in this case a tank bullet. Depending on the spin, the ball will travel with different trajectories. For example, top spin will make the ball travel further, but not go as high. Backspin will cause the opposite, more height and less distance. The formula for the magnus effect is as follows:\n",
