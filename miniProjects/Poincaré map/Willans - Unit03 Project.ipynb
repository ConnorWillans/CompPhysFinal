    "The goal for this project was to create the Poincaré map of a damped driven pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poincaré map is a plot of omega ($\\omega$) vs. theta ($\\theta$), when plotting points at specific times. For example, when it reaches a minimum or maximum, timed with the driving force. It's also important that we restrict our results between: -$\\pi$,$\\pi$, as it makes it easier to study."
