# CompPhysFinal
The repository features a collection of work I've done in Computational Physics.
Some smaller projects we did during the semester are located inside the folder

The main program is the tanks game I made for our final project 
It features 8 levels to play through, where you must aim a tank to hit a target.

I incorporated a few physic elements, such as:
- Projectile Motion
- Magnus Effect
- Air Resistance / Drag
